Hello! I'm a passionate investor with a strong background in programming. By leveraging Python and the Interactive Brokers API, I gather and analyze historical market data to conduct algorithmic trading and research. I'm excited to share my work with you and encourage you to use the code I've developed for your own purposes. I primarily use Spyder as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
