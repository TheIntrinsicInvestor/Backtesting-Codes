Hi! I'm a passionate investor that possesses programming skills. Using Python and Interactive Broker's API, I draw historical data and perform algorithmic trading/research on these findings. Feel free to use the codes I've created for your own intentions. The IDE that I use is Spyder.
My website where I post these reports accompanied by write-ups: TheIntrinsicInvestor.com
